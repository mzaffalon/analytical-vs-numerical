    "text": "We would be given the linear time-invariant equation\n\\[ \\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)  \\tag{1}\\]\nwith initial condition \\(x(0)=x_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a \\(n\\times n\\) matrix with constant coefficient. In control systems, this equation comes either from the free evolution of the system (without control input, \\(u=0\\)) or from the closed loop evolution \\(A-BL\\) under the state feedback law \\(u=-Lx\\).\nThe solution is\n\\[ x(t) = e^{At}x_0. \\]\nOne way to compute the matrix exponential is to use the Jordan normal form decomposition \\(AV = VJ\\) since most often than not, \\(A\\) cannot be diagonalised. \\(J\\) is a block diagonal matrix where each Jordan block \\(J_i\\) would have \\(\\lambda_i\\) on the diagonal and \\(1\\) on the superdiagonal.\nThe exponent \\(e^{Jt}\\) is also block diagonal and each block has the form \\[ e^{J_it} = e^{\\lambda_it} \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & t      & \\frac{t^2}{2!} & \\ldots & \\frac{t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \\\\\n  & 1      & t              & \\ldots & \\frac{t^{n-2}}{(n-2)!} \\\\\n  &        & \\ddots         & \\ddots \\\\\n  &        &                & 1      & t \\\\\n  &        &                &        & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}. \\]\nThe problem is that the Jordan decomposition is numerically unstable as explained in MATLAB’s help, if one bothered to read it and should be used only for symbolic computation in exact arithmetics. We happily ignored this fact, although Dörfler made the effort to remind us.\nThe numerical evalution of \\(e^{At}\\) requires care as pointed out in Moler and Loan (2003) and MATLAB’s help for expm."

    "text": "Can a System Be Useful Only if it is Stable?\nLukas Ortmann made a brilliant remark: “Even if the system is unstable, it does not mean I cannot use it. Just make sure that it still remains”bounded” within the experimental time.”\nThis obvious comment is brilliant because it is made in the context of the introductionary courses that fail to communicate that the stability per se is not relevant without comparing with the experiment time scale. The Sun is an unstable system and will turn into a red giant star in 5 billion years (give or take a few million years) (see for instance here). Do I lay awake at night because of this?"

    "text": "Use of rank for the Controllability and Observability Matrices\nThe discussion about the rank came up during exercise hour in the context of the controllability matrix.\nA system is controllable if the controllability matrix is full rank. Mathematically this may be true, but what if I designed a locomotive that uses bike brakes1? The controllability matrix is full rank. And oh, did I mention that the plant has a settling time of 2 days and 7 hours? What the discussion fails to make explicit is that what is relevant is not whether the system is controllable but rather to what degree it is controllable.\nIt seems wrong to use the discrete function rank in a continuous world. What is a good threshold for controllability? Why is a car that requires 10 turns of the steering wheel controllable but another car is incontrollable if it requires 11 turns? Moreover from experience, when I obtain experimental values with an accuracy of 1% or better, I have won the lottery. Should I set the threshold to \\(10^{-2}\\)?\nI have asked Prof. Zeilinger (eventual errors are mine). Her answer was\n\nit should only be applied to system models obtained from first principles and not, for instance, by system identification;\nno better definition of controllability/observability exists."
